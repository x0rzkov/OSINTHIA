# OSINTHIA

The name "OSINTHIA" is sort of a random play on words combining what this repository is about, Open-Source InTelligence, and Cynthia which has nothing to do with this rep.

As of now, 10/12/2020 at 1:08AM, I have a few ideas in mind regarding this project but that is almost all I have so far.

A few things:

  Logs:
    On all my commits, new logs notes, and anything else, a combination of the date format ddmmyyyy and military time will be used to document the exact date and time I began. This becomes quite tedious so I have written a program called 'loggit.py' which currently does that for me, along with asking my current location, city, what my commit message is, and the commit number stated as a log.

    The full format that I am currently using appears as such:
    101220200120 Waffle House {city}, TX-log 5| Writing the description for a new repository called 'OSINTHIA' where I am currently explaining the format for all future logs.

    I used to actually put the city I was in but I am thinking about removing that feature for github projects.

    I had been listing the python program under the '.gitignore' file but I am going to leave it visible for this project. Open-source material is truly amazing and I really do want to contribute to the programming community and hopefully be helpful in some way, whatever that may be.

  Project:
    As of now, the project will be geared towards creating a terminal-based program that will utilize the urls provided by the OSINT-Framework by the github user lockfale...the link to their repository: https://github.com/lockfale/OSINT-Framework.git
    I haven't created a successful github repository so I'm not completely certain about the extent that I am actually allowed to utilize the info provided. I will be sure to figure it out, but regardless of how much or how little I am allowed to use, I still was to thank lockfale for providing such a convenient tool for anyone to use. This stuff is awesome.

    Once I actually develop a plan, I will be sure to explain all there is to know about the repository which I am starting....now!
